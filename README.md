# Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process the data, machine learning models were created capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

This project includes the following tasks:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Performed feature selection and removed unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compared at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about the findings and any assumptions made based on the model (is the model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make the model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
